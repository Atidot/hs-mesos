## Current status

Full API bindings consistent with the API provided by Mesos 0.20.x.

## Areas that need contributions:

- [ ] Examples
- [ ] Updating API to include support for new functionality in Mesos 0.22.x
- [ ] Somebody to tell me how to write C++ properly.

## Contributing

Maintaining the C++ bindings for Mesos are quite a bit of work. If you want to help make this project better, just ask and I'll gladly give commit access.
